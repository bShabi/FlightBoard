ðŸ“Œ Project Description
The Flight Board Management System is a real-time application designed to manage and display flights in a live flight board.
It allows administrators to add, edit, and delete flights, while automatically calculating and updating each flightâ€™s status based on its scheduled departure time.

Dynamic flight status calculation (Scheduled, Boarding, Departed, Landed) based on departure time

Real-time synchronization between all users via SignalR

Search and filter flights by multiple criteria

Animated table row updates for better user experience (Framer Motion)

Backend: ASP.NET Core 6 Web API + SQLite

Frontend: React + TypeScript + Material UI
